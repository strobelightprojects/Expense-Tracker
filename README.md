# Overview
I created this program to start working with the Java programming language. In this program, I created a basic expense tracker that breaks expenses into 4 categories and then adds the totals for these categories. I Made it so it will store the data entered into a Txt file that will store the category name of the expense and the amount and also the date and time the entry was entered. After adding expenses, the program will display the total expenses for each category stored in the Txt file. Overall I achieved my purpose with this project of practicing working with Java.

# Future Work

- Allow the date and time to be put in instead of just putting in the current date and time  
- Make it so the program can create a new file to read and write to based on month or year of expense
- Modify the different categories and add more categories
- Add the total summary by category into the text file
- Add the option to remove an added entry
- Add the option to view past entries while in the program
- Add the option to change past entries
